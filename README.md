# 🌱 IoT Roots #2 – ESP8266 to ESP32 Weather Display

This project is part of the **IoT Roots Series**, where we start from simple IoT communication projects and gradually build toward a **complete Agri-IoT system** 🌾.  

In this project:  
- **ESP8266** reads temperature & humidity data from a **DHT22 sensor** and luminosity from a **BH1750**.  
- The readings are transmitted wirelessly via **ESP-NOW**.  
- **ESP32** receives the data and displays it on an **OLED screen** in real time.

## 🖼️ Demo Setup

- ESP8266 (DHT22 + BH1750) -> ESP-NOW -> ESP32 (OLED Display)

## ⚡ Setup & Instructions

### 1. Requirements
- ESP8266 board  
- ESP32 board (board version: **2.0.17**)  
- DHT22 sensor
- BH1750 sensor
- OLED Display (SSD1306, I2C)  
- Arduino IDE  

### 2. Get MAC Address
Before uploading the codes:  
- Upload `GetMAC.ino` to each board.  
- Open **Serial Monitor** to see the **MAC Address**.  
- Convert it into **hexadecimal format** (if required).  
- Replace the address inside the code accordingly.  

### 3. Upload Codes
- Flash **ESP66-v2** code to ESP8266.  
- Flash **ESP32-v2** code to ESP32.  

---

## 📊 Output
- ESP8266 reads `Temperature + Humidity + Luminosity`.  
- ESP32 displays results like:
  -- Temp: 28.4°C
  -- Humidity: 65.2%
  -- SunLight: Dark/Dim/Cloudy/Sunny
- 
on the OLED in real time.
